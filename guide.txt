1. REST interface
-----------------
A. Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shall follow current version of Open API Specification(OAS). Refer to the OAS specifications at https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html

B. Naming rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following rules shall be followed for naming the resources and URIs used in the REST interfaces:
Resources:
 - Use nouns for naming resources
 - Use singular nouns in cases where reference is being made to a singleton resource
 - Use plural nouns for cases where reference made could either be to a collection or singleton resource based on condition
 - Resources should be identified by one word nouns only
 - Use only lowercase letters for identifying the resources
 - When a significant new behaviour of an existing resource is provided, use the version number after the resource in the URI. Example - /employee would refer to original version and /employee/v1 would refer to new version. The original version will not have any version information. Subsequent revisions shall be identified by /v1, /v2, etc.
URIs:
 - Hierarchical resource relationships should be represented by forward slash (/) 
 - Do not use trailing forward slash (/) in the URI
 - Use only resource names as part of the URIs
 - CRUD oprations should be indicated as part of the HTTP methods
 - Use query component to filter URI collection
